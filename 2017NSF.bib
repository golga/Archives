abstract = {The temperature dependence of the magnetic-resonance spectra of nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) ensembles in the range of 280-330 K was studied. Four samples prepared under different conditions were analyzed with NV- concentrations ranging from 10 ppb to 15 ppm. For all samples, the axial zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameter D was found to vary significantly with temperature, T, as dD/dT=-74.2(7) kHz/K. The transverse ZFS parameter E was nonzero (between 4 and 11 MHz) in all samples, and exhibited a temperature dependence of dE/(EdT)=-1.4(3)x10{\{}-4{\}} K-1. The results might be accounted for by considering local thermal expansion. The temperature dependence of the ZFS parameters presents a significant challenge for diamond magnetometers and may ultimately limit their bandwidth and sensitivity.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

Moreover, N–V centre ensembles can have spin-coherence times exceeding 50 µs at room temperature. We have developed an angle-resolved magneto-photoluminescence microscope apparatus to investigate the anisotropic electron-spin interactions of single N–V centres at room temperature. We observe negative peaks in the photoluminescence as a function of both magnetic-field magnitude and angle that are explained by coherent spin precession and anisotropic relaxation at spin-level anti-crossings. In addition, precise field alignment unmasks the resonant coupling to neighbouring ‘dark' nitrogen spins, otherwise undetected by photoluminescence. These results demonstrate the capability of our spectroscopic technique for measuring small numbers of dark spins by means of a single bright spin under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Coherent coupling between single quantum objects is at the very heart of modern quantum physics. When the coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it can be used to engineer quantum entangled states. Entangled states have attracted widespread attention because of applications to quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. For such applications, solid-state hosts are preferred for scalability reasons, and spins are the preferred quantum system in solids because they offer long coherence times. Here we show that a single pair of strongly coupled spins in diamond, associated with a nitrogen-vacancy defect and a nitrogen atom, respectively, can be optically initialized and read out at room temperature. To effect this strong coupling, close proximity of the two spins is required, but large distances from other spins are needed to avoid deleterious decoherence. These requirements were reconciled by implanting molecular nitrogen into high-purity diamond.},

abstract = {Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern science and technology. In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.},

The optical fiber sensors have certain advantages that include immunity to electromagnetic interference, lightweight, small size, high sensitivity, large bandwidth, and ease in implementing multiplexed or distributed sensors. Strain, temperature and pressure are the most widely studied measurands and the fiber grating sensor represents the most widely studied technology for optical fiber sensors. Fiber-optic gyroscopes and fiber-optic current sensors are good examples of rather mature and commercialized optical fiber sensor technologies. In this paper, among the various fiber-optic sensor technologies, especially, technologies such as fiber grating sensors, fiber-optic gyroscopes, and fiber-optic current sensors are discussed with emphasis on the principles and current status. Today, some success has been found in the commercialization of optical fiber sensors. However, in various fields they still suffer from competition with other mature sensor technologies. However, new ideas are being continuously developed and tested not only for the traditional measurands but also for new applications. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We analyse the sensitivity of the system to the magnetic field generated by an axon transmembrane potential and confirm these predictions experimentally using electronically-generated neuron signals. By numerical simulation of the time dependent transmembrane potential of a morphologically reconstructed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron, we show that the imaging system is capable of imaging planar neuron activity non-invasively at millisecond temporal resolution and micron spatial resolution over wide-fields.},

abstract = {Magnetic imaging is a powerful tool for probing biological and physical systems. However, existing techniques either have poor spatial resolution compared to optical microscopy and are hence not generally applicable to imaging of sub-cellular structure (for example, magnetic resonance imaging), or entail operating conditions that preclude application to living biological samples while providing submicrometre resolution (for example, scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy, electron holography and magnetic resonance force microscopy). Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states and rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks.},

abstract = {Detection of weak magnetic fields with nanoscale spatial resolution is an outstanding problem in the biological and physical sciences. For example, at a distance of 10 nm, the spin of a single electron produces a magnetic field of about 1 muT, and the corresponding field from a single proton is a few nanoteslas. A sensor able to detect such magnetic fields with nanometre spatial resolution would enable powerful applications, ranging from the detection of magnetic resonance signals from individual electron or nuclear spins in complex biological molecules to readout of classical or quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory. Here we experimentally demonstrate an approach to such nanoscale magnetic sensing, using coherent manipulation of an individual electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen-vacancy impurity in diamond at room temperature. Using an ultra-pure diamond sample, we achieve detection of 3 nT magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies after 100 s of averaging. In addition, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 0.5 muT Hz(-1/2) for a diamond nanocrystal with a diameter of 30 nm.},

Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long ({\textgreater}10 h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1 degrees angular precision over acquisition times of 89 ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously. Furthermore, monitoring decoherence rates in response to changes in the local environment may provide new information about intracellular processes.

Here we demonstrate quantitative magnetic field mapping with nanoscale resolution, by applying a lock-in technique on the ESR frequency of a single NV defect placed at the apex of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. To illustrate the efficiency of the technique, we image a commercial magnetic hard disk and observe good agreement with the simulated magnetic field distributions. In addition, we demonstrate a novel all-optical magnetic imaging technique which is sensitive to large magnetic fields lying in a range usually considered as non accessible to diamond-based magnetometry. It relies on magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) of the NV defect magnetic probe, induced by spin level mixing. This method allows us to directly resolve the nanoscale magnetic bit structure of the hard disk. Owing to the non-perturbing nature of the magnetic probe, this work should open up numerous perspectives in nanomagnetism and spintronics.},

Nanoscale thermometry of aqueous solutions is a challenging but crucial technique to understand the molecular basis of this essential process. Here, we developed a ratiometric nanothermometer (RNT) for intracellular temperature measurement in real time. Both the thermosensitive fluorophore, $\beta$-diketonate chelate europium(III) thenoyltrifluoroacetonate, and the thermoinsensitive fluorophore, rhodamine 101, which was used as a self-reference, are embedded in a polymeric particle that protects the fluorophores from intracellular conditions. The ratiometric measurement of single RNT spots is independent of the displacement of the RNT along the z-axis. The temperature is therefore determined at the location of each RNT under an optical microscope regardless of the dynamic movement of living cells. As a demonstration of the spot-by-spot intracellular thermometry, we successfully followed the temperature change in individual RNT spots in a single cell together with the Ca(2+) burst induced by the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin. The temperature increases differently among different spots, implying heterogeneous heat production in the cell. We then show that, in some spots, the temperature gradually decreases, while in others it remains high. The average temperature elevation within a cell is positively correlated to the increase in Ca(2+), suggesting that the activity and/or number of heat sources are dependent on the Ca(2+) concentration.},

Thermal conductivity measurements on natural and synthetic diamond, cubic BN, BP and AIN confirm that all of them are high thermal conductivity solids. Studies have been made of the effect on the thermal conductivity of nitrogen impurities in diamond, and oxygen impurities in AIN. The nitrogen impurities scatter phonons mostly from the strain field, the oxygen impurities scatter phonons mostly from the mass defects caused by aluminum vacancies. Pure A1N as well as pure SiC, BeO, BP and BeS conduct heat almost as well as does copper at room temperature, while pure natural and synthetic diamonds conduct heat five times better than copper. All of the nonmetallic solids that are known to possess high thermal conductivity have either the diamond-like, boron carbide, or graphite crystal structure. There are twelve different diamond-like crystals, a few boron carbide-type crystals, and two graphite structure crystals that have high thermal conductivity. Analyses of the rock-salt, fluorite, quartz, corundum and other structures show no candidates for this class. The four rules for finding crystals with high thermal conductivity are that the crystal should have (1) low atomic mass, (2) strong bonding, (3) simple crystal structure, and (4) low anharmonicity. The prime example of such a solid is diamond, which has the highest known thermal conductivity at 300K.},
