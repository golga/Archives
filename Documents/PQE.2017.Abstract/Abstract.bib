abstract = {Laser-induced fluorescence quenching in nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is studied simultaneously with in situ measurements of the heating-induced shift of the electron spin resonance of NV centers in the presence of a microwave field. These experiments reveal a strong correlation between fluorescence suppression in NV centers and the rise of the lo- cal temperature inside the diamond crystal. This finding sheds light on quantum pathways behind stimulated fluorescence quenching in NV centers of diamond and may imply signifi- cant limitations on the applications of this effect as a method of superresolving imaging in biological systems.},

abstract = {Differential optical detection of a magnetic resonance induced in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is shown to enable a high-spatial-resolution room-temperature magnetic-field gradiometry on a fiber platform. An ultracompact design of this fiber-based solid-state magnetic gradiometer is achieved by integrating an NV-diamond magnetic sensor with a two-fiber opto-microwave interface, which couples NV centers to microwave and optical fields, used to resonantly drive and interrogate the spin of NV centers.},
