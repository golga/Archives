In our experiments, the temporally modulated STED technique, implemented with low-intensity continuous-wave laser sources, is shown to provide an efficient all-optical suppression of a broadband fluorescent background, allowing the contrast of fluorescent images of mammal brain tissues tagged with nitrogen-vacancy diamond to be increased by five orders of magnitude.},

For example, it allows the electronic spin state of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond to be initialized and read out using optical fields at ambient temperatures. This capability has enabled a wide array of applications in metrology and quantum information science. Here, we develop a microscopic model of the state-selective ISC from the optical excited state manifold of the NV center. By correlating the electron-phonon interactions that mediate the ISC with those that induce population dynamics within the NV center's excited state manifold and those that produce the phonon sidebands of its optical transitions, we quantitatively demonstrate that our model is consistent with recent ISC measurements. Furthermore, our model constrains the unknown energy spacings between the center's spin-singlet and spin-triplet levels. Finally, we discuss prospects to engineer the ISC in order to improve the spin initialization and readout fidelities of NV centers.},

We demonstrate a new method for efficient spin readout of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The method is based on conversion of the electronic spin state of the NV to a charge state distribution, followed by single-shot readout of the charge state. Conversion is achieved through a spin-dependent photoionization process in diamond at room temperature. Using NVs in nanofabricated diamond beams, we demonstrate that the resulting spin readout noise is within a factor of three of the spin projection noise level.

abstract = {The homeostasis of body temperature and energy balance is one of the major principles in biology. Nanoscale thermometry of aqueous solutions is a challenging but crucial technique to understand the molecular basis of this essential process. Here, we developed a ratiometric nanothermometer (RNT) for intracellular temperature measurement in real time. Both the thermosensitive fluorophore, $\beta$-diketonate chelate europium(III) thenoyltrifluoroacetonate, and the thermoinsensitive fluorophore, rhodamine 101, which was used as a self-reference, are embedded in a polymeric particle that protects the fluorophores from intracellular conditions. The ratiometric measurement of single RNT spots is independent of the displacement of the RNT along the z-axis. The temperature is therefore determined at the location of each RNT under an optical microscope regardless of the dynamic movement of living cells. As a demonstration of the spot-by-spot intracellular thermometry, we successfully followed the temperature change in individual RNT spots in a single cell together with the Ca(2+) burst induced by the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin. The temperature increases differently among different spots, implying heterogeneous heat production in the cell. We then show that, in some spots, the temperature gradually decreases, while in others it remains high. The average temperature elevation within a cell is positively correlated to the increase in Ca(2+), suggesting that the activity and/or number of heat sources are dependent on the Ca(2+) concentration.},

Under typical conditions, the NV can have two stable charge states, negative (NV − ) or neutral (NV 0 ), with photo-induced interconversion of these two states. Here, we present detailed studies of the ionization dynamics of single NV centres in bulk diamond at room temperature during illumination and its dependence on the excitation wavelength and power. We apply a recent method which allows us to directly measure the charge state of a single NV centre, and observe its temporal evolution. We find that the steady-state NV − population is always ⩽75{\%} for 450–610 nm excitation wavelength. In combination with saturation measurements, we show that the optimal excitation wavelength is around 510–540 nm. Furthermore, the relative absorption cross-section of NV − is determined for 540–610 nm, revealing a double-peak structure. Finally, the energy of the NV − ground state of 2.6 eV below the conduction band is measured. These results reveal new insights into the charge state dynamics of the NV centre.},

In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.},

abstract = {Magnetic imaging is a powerful tool for probing biological and physical systems. However, existing techniques either have poor spatial resolution compared to optical microscopy and are hence not generally applicable to imaging of sub-cellular structure (for example, magnetic resonance imaging), or entail operating conditions that preclude application to living biological samples while providing submicrometre resolution (for example, scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy, electron holography and magnetic resonance force microscopy). Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states and rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks.},

abstract = {Diamond nanocrystals containing nitrogen–vacancy (NV) color centers have been used in recent years as fluorescent probes for near-field and cellular imaging. In this work, we report that an infrared (IR) pulsed excitation beam can quench the photoluminescence of a NV color center in a diamond nanocrystal (size {\textless}50 nm) with an extinction ratio as high as ≈90{\%}. We attribute this effect to the heating of the nanocrystal consecutive to multi-photon absorption by the diamond matrix. This quenching is reversible: the photoluminescence intensity goes back to its original value when the IR laser beam is turned off, with a typical response time of 100 ps, allowing for fast control of NV color center photoluminescence. We used this effect to achieve the sub-diffraction-limited imaging of fluorescent diamond nanocrystals on a coverglass. For that, as in the ground state depletion super-resolution technique, we combined the green excitation laser beam with the control IR depleting one after shaping its intensity profile in a doughnut form, so that the emission comes only from the sub-wavelength size central part.},

abstract = {Zero-phonon-line (ZPL) emission of nitrogen vacancies (NVs) is coupled to the guided modes of solid-and hollow-core nanodiamond-doped photonic-crystal fibers (PCFs). Both types of PCFs are tailored toward enhancing ZPL emission coupling to the fiber modes. In solid-core PCFs, this involves enhancing the evanescent field of the waveguide modes supported by an ultrasmall fiber core. In hollow-core PCFs, the NV emission spectrum is matched with the transmission band of the fiber, controlled by the photonic bands of the fiber cladding. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {A quantitative understanding of the dynamics of biological neural networks is fundamental to gaining insight into information processing in the brain. While techniques exist to measure spatial or temporal properties of these networks, it remains a significant challenge to resolve the neural dynamics with subcellular spatial resolution. In this work we consider a fundamentally new form of wide-field imaging for neuronal networks based on the nanoscale magnetic field sensing properties of optically active spins in a diamond substrate. We analyse the sensitivity of the system to the magnetic field generated by an axon transmembrane potential and confirm these predictions experimentally using electronically-generated neuron signals. By numerical simulation of the time dependent transmembrane potential of a morphologically reconstructed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron, we show that the imaging system is capable of imaging planar neuron activity non-invasively at millisecond temporal resolution and micron spatial resolution over wide-fields.},

The spatial and temperature resolutions of our thermometry were at the diffraction limited level (200 nm) and 0.18-0.58 °C. The intracellular temperature distribution we observed indicated that the nucleus and centrosome of a COS7 cell, both showed a significantly higher temperature than the cytoplasm and that the temperature gap between the nucleus and the cytoplasm differed depending on the cell cycle. The heat production from mitochondria was also observed as a proximal local temperature increase. These results showed that our new intracellular thermometry could determine an intrinsic relationship between the temperature and organelle function.},

abstract = {The ability to map magnetic field distributions with high sensitivity and nanoscale resolution is of crucial importance for fundamental studies ranging from material science to biology, as well as for the development of new applications in spintronics and quantum technology. Recently, it was shown that the optical detection of the electron spin resonance (ESR) associated with a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defect in diamond provides an unprecedented combination of magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution under ambient conditions. Here we demonstrate quantitative magnetic field mapping with nanoscale resolution, by applying a lock-in technique on the ESR frequency of a single NV defect placed at the apex of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. To illustrate the efficiency of the technique, we image a commercial magnetic hard disk and observe good agreement with the simulated magnetic field distributions. In addition, we demonstrate a novel all-optical magnetic imaging technique which is sensitive to large magnetic fields lying in a range usually considered as non accessible to diamond-based magnetometry. It relies on magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) of the NV defect magnetic probe, induced by spin level mixing. This method allows us to directly resolve the nanoscale magnetic bit structure of the hard disk. Owing to the non-perturbing nature of the magnetic probe, this work should open up numerous perspectives in nanomagnetism and spintronics.},

Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long ({\textgreater}10 h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1 degrees angular precision over acquisition times of 89 ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously. Furthermore, monitoring decoherence rates in response to changes in the local environment may provide new information about intracellular processes. The experiments reported here demonstrate the viability of controlled single spin probes for nanomagnetometry in biological systems, opening up a host of new possibilities for quantum-based imaging in the life sciences.},

Although several experiments indicate their existence, lipid nanodomains ('rafts') remain controversial owing to the lack of suitable detection techniques in living cells. The controversy is reflected in their putative size of 5-200 nm, spanning the range between the extent of a protein complex and the resolution limit of optical microscopy. Here we demonstrate the ability of stimulated emission depletion (STED) far-field fluorescence nanoscopy to detect single diffusing (lipid) molecules in nanosized areas in the plasma membrane of living cells. Tuning of the probed area to spot sizes approximately 70-fold below the diffraction barrier reveals that unlike phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are transiently ( approximately 10-20 ms) trapped in cholesterol-mediated molecular complexes dwelling within {\textless}20-nm diameter areas. The non-invasive optical recording of molecular time traces and fluctuation data in tunable nanoscale domains is a powerful new approach to study the dynamics of biomolecules in living cells.},

abstract = {Charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond are excellent luminescence sources for far-field fluorescence nanoscopy by stimulated emission depletion (STED). Here we show that these photostable color centers can be visualized by STED using simple continuous-wave or high repetition pulsed lasers (76 MHz) at wavelengths {\textgreater}700 nm for STED. Furthermore, we show that NV centers can be imaged in three dimensions (3D) inside the diamond crystal and present single-photon signatures of single color centers recorded in high density samples, demonstrating a new recording scheme for STED and related far-field nanoscopy approaches. Finally, we exemplify the potential of using nanodiamonds containing NV centers as luminescence tags in STED microscopy. Our results offer new experimental avenues in nanooptics, nanotechnology, and the life sciences.},

The four possible orientations of the NV-center in the lattice lead to different dependences on the magnitude and the orientation of an external static magnetic field. Experimental results obtained with a continuous microwave excitation are in good agreement with simulations. In addition, we observe that the average radiative lifetime of the NV color center is also modified when the external magnetic field is applied. This variation is explained by the mixing between mS = 0 and mS = {\$}\backslashpm{\$}1 spin states of the NV-center with different radiative lifetimes, due to magnetic coupling.

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

For example, at a distance of 10 nm, the spin of a single electron produces a magnetic field of about 1 muT, and the corresponding field from a single proton is a few nanoteslas. A sensor able to detect such magnetic fields with nanometre spatial resolution would enable powerful applications, ranging from the detection of magnetic resonance signals from individual electron or nuclear spins in complex biological molecules to readout of classical or quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory. Here we experimentally demonstrate an approach to such nanoscale magnetic sensing, using coherent manipulation of an individual electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen-vacancy impurity in diamond at room temperature. Using an ultra-pure diamond sample, we achieve detection of 3 nT magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies after 100 s of averaging. In addition, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 0.5 muT Hz(-1/2) for a diamond nanocrystal with a diameter of 30 nm.},

We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.},

When the coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it can be used to engineer quantum entangled states. Entangled states have attracted widespread attention because of applications to quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. For such applications, solid-state hosts are preferred for scalability reasons, and spins are the preferred quantum system in solids because they offer long coherence times. Here we show that a single pair of strongly coupled spins in diamond, associated with a nitrogen-vacancy defect and a nitrogen atom, respectively, can be optically initialized and read out at room temperature. To effect this strong coupling, close proximity of the two spins is required, but large distances from other spins are needed to avoid deleterious decoherence. These requirements were reconciled by implanting molecular nitrogen into high-purity diamond.},

We have developed an angle-resolved magneto-photoluminescence microscope apparatus to investigate the anisotropic electron-spin interactions of single N–V centres at room temperature. We observe negative peaks in the photoluminescence as a function of both magnetic-field magnitude and angle that are explained by coherent spin precession and anisotropic relaxation at spin-level anti-crossings.

abstract = {We report on the realization of a stable solid state room temperature source for single photons. It is based on the fluorescence of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in a diamond nanocrystal. Antibunching has been observed in the fluorescence light under both continuous and pulsed excitation. Our source delivers 2*10{\^{}}4 single-photon pulses per second at an excitation repetition rate of 10 MHz. The number of two-photon pulses is reduced by a factor of five compared to strongly attenuated coherent sources.},

abstract = {The fluorescence of individual nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond was observed with room-temperature scanning confocal optical microscopy. The centers were photostable, showing no detectable change in their fluorescence emission spectrum as a function of time. Magnetic resonance on single centers at room temperature was shown to be feasible. The magnetic resonance spectra revealed marked changes in zero-field splitting parameters among different centers. These changes were attributed to strain-induced differences in the symmetry of the centers.},

abstract = {Nonmetallic crystals transport heat primarily by phonons at room temperature and below. There are only a few nonmetallic crystals which can be classed as high thermal conductivity solids, in the sense of having a thermal conductivity of {\textgreater} 1 W/cmK at 300K. Thermal conductivity measurements on natural and synthetic diamond, cubic BN, BP and AIN confirm that all of them are high thermal conductivity solids. Studies have been made of the effect on the thermal conductivity of nitrogen impurities in diamond, and oxygen impurities in AIN. The nitrogen impurities scatter phonons mostly from the strain field, the oxygen impurities scatter phonons mostly from the mass defects caused by aluminum vacancies. Pure A1N as well as pure SiC, BeO, BP and BeS conduct heat almost as well as does copper at room temperature, while pure natural and synthetic diamonds conduct heat five times better than copper. All of the nonmetallic solids that are known to possess high thermal conductivity have either the diamond-like, boron carbide, or graphite crystal structure. There are twelve different diamond-like crystals, a few boron carbide-type crystals, and two graphite structure crystals that have high thermal conductivity. Analyses of the rock-salt, fluorite, quartz, corundum and other structures show no candidates for this class. The four rules for finding crystals with high thermal conductivity are that the crystal should have (1) low atomic mass, (2) strong bonding, (3) simple crystal structure, and (4) low anharmonicity. The prime example of such a solid is diamond, which has the highest known thermal conductivity at 300K. ?? 1973.},
