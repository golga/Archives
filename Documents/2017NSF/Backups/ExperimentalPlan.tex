\section{Methodology and General Work Program}
Electron spin of individual center can be manipulated by light, magnetic, electric and microwave fields. This
allows recording quantum information as well as high precision measurement of electromagnetic field and
temperature. Optical initialization of NV$^-$ can be achieved with wavelengths between 480 nm and 620
nm, with the most common techniques using a 532 nm source based on second-harmonic output of a continuous-wave 
Nd:YAG laser. This laser radiation couples the $^3\textnormal{A}_2$ ground electronic state to the $^3$E excited 
state, giving rise to
photoluminescence (downward red arrows, Fig.\ref{NVBackgroundFig}b, right), featuring a characteristic zero-
phonon line, which is
observed at approximately 637 nm at room temperature against a broad phonon-sideband stretching into the NIR 
(Fig. \ref{NVBackgroundFig}a, left).

Diagram of energy levels involved in electron-spin spectroscopy. The ground state of NV$^-$ is a
spin-triplet state with a zero-field splitting $\Omega_s\approx2.87\unit{GHz}$. When tuned to the ESR frequency $\Omega_s$, a microwave
field efficiently transfers population from the $m_s = 0$ to the $m_s = \pm1$ state. An optical pump at $532\unit{nm}$ couples
the $^{3}A_{2}$ ground electronic state to the $^{3}E$ excited state, giving rise to photoluminescence, shown by the red line,
featuring a characteristic zero-phonon line at approximately $637\unit{nm}$, which is observed in the spectrum of
photoluminescence (shown on the left) against a broad phonon-sideband line, stretching down to $800\unit{nm}$. An
external magnetic field removes the degeneracy of the $m_s = \pm1$ state and induces a Zeeman frequency shift
$2\delta\omega$ between these
sublevels. A substantial fraction of the $m_s = \pm1$ excited-state population is transferred to the $m_s = 0$
ground level via a metastable 1E singlet state.}

\end{figure}

The electron spin of the NV ground-state triplet can be manipulated by a microwave field via electron spin
resonance (ESR). The spin part of the electron Hamiltonian of an NV center in the presence of an external magnetic
field B is written as $H_s=\mu_B g\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{S}+hD[S_z^2-(S(S+1))/3]+hE(S_x^2-S_y^2)$, where 
$\mu_b$ is the Bohr magneton, $g\approx 2$ is the electron g-ratio, $D$ and $E$ are the zero-magnetic-field
splitting parameters, and $S_j \ (j = z, y, z)$ are the projections of the electron spin $S$ on the principal
Cartesian coordinate axes $x, y, z,$ with the z-axis chosen along the NV axis. The first term in this Hamiltonian
describes the Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field, which is observed against zero-field splitting due to
spin-spin interactions in the vacancy site.  This zero field splitting is governed by the second and third terms
in $H_s$, dominated by the splitting $\Omega_s = D \approx 2.87\unit{GHz}$ (where h is the Planck constant) between the $m_s = 0$ spin state
and the twofold-degenerate $m_s = \pm1$ state (Fig. \ref{NVBackgroundFig}b).  When the microwave field is tuned to the ESR frequency $\Omega_s$,
this microwave field efficiently transfers population from the $m_s = 0$ to the $m_s = \pm1$ state (Fig. \ref{NVBackgroundFig}b), thus
manipulating spin orientation. For NV$^-$ in the $m_s = \pm1$ state, the photoluminescence yield is lower than
that typical of NV$^-$ in the $m_s = 0$ state.  This is because a substantial fraction of the $m_s = \pm1$ excited
state population is transferred to the $m_s = 0$ ground level via a metastable singlet state ($^{1}E$ state in Fig. \ref{NVBackgroundFig}b).
This pathway is non-radiative, therefore allowing optical detection of ESR by reading out the spin state from the
intensity of the photoluminescence signal. An external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ removes the degeneracy of the
$m_s = \pm1$ state and induces a Zeeman frequency splitting $\Delta\Omega{Z}$ between the $m_s = \pm1$ sublevels (Fig. \ref{NVBackgroundFig}b). Since the
photoluminescence from $m_s = \pm1$ levels is weaker than the photoluminescence from $m_s = 0$ states, the Zeeman-shifted
sublevels are observed as B-dependent features in the ODMR spectrum measured as a function of the microwave
frequency $\Omega$.

The proposed research is aimed at advancing the fundamental understanding of the NV singlet state that will
inspire new and novel high contrast optical, temperature, and magnetic field imaging techniques.  As a part of
the proposed research program, we plan to achieve the following goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use selective ionization of the NV$^-$ from the singlet state to determine the separation between the singlet state and the conduction band edge.
\item Develop a technique for enhanced contrast ODMR that involves tying the NV$^-$ spin state to the population in the NV$^0$ state via selective photoionization of the NV$^-$ singlet state.
\item Leverage the enhanced contrast ODMR technique to improve the temperature and magnetic field sensitivity of our fiber NVD probes for the purpose of deep tissue weak field diagnostics.
\item Determine the dependence of ODMR contrast on the NVD temperature and on the wavelength of IR radiation targeted at the transition in the singlet manifold.
\item Develop a novel temperature sensitive STED technique immune to background autofluorescence.
\end{enumerate}

Correspondingly, the proposed activities are divided into the following work packages (WP): NV singlet 
ionization (WP1), high contrast ODMR (WP2), enhanced sensitivity fiber NVD probes for deep tissue weak field 
diagnostics (WP3), characterization of ODMR dependence on temperature and IR radiation (WP4), and temperature 
sensitive super-resolution STED imaging (WP5). Wherein the stated goals of the WP1-3 motivate each 
subsequent work plan (Fig. \ref{WP123FlowChart}). Also the results for WP4 provide the preliminary results 
for WP5 (Fig. \ref{WP45FlowChart})

\subsection{WP1: NV Singlet Ionization}
A deeper understanding of the NV singlet state is a necessity for the development of new applications of the NV
center and for pushing existing measurement regimes into previously inaccessible realms.  In this work package we
intend to demonstrate a technique for ionization of the NV center singlet state.  We plan to use this to measure of the energy separation between the singlet state and the conduction band edge by investigating the fluorescence amplitude of the newly created NV$^0$ as a function of input ionization wavelength.

Our experimental plan to accomplish this goal will involve pumping the NV center into the singlet state by first spin
polarizing the NV center into the $m_s = 0$ ground state sublevel with a pulse of $532\unit{nm}$ laser
excitation
lasting not more than the lifetime of the singlet state ($\sim200\unit{ns}$ at room temperature
\cite{Dreau2011}) from a frequency
doubled Nd:YAG laser modulated with an AOM (Fig. \ref{WP1Schematic}).  We will then populate the singlet
state with a microwave
$\pi$-pulse resonant with the ground state Zeeman splitting followed by another $532\unit{nm}$ laser
pulse with a duration of
$100\unit{ns}$ (approximately 10 excited state lifetimes) to ensure the population has a chance to
transition into the
singlet state via its 50\% ISC with the $m_s = \pm1$ excited state sublevels.  We will then immediately apply a
short, intense
probe ionization pulse with variable wavelength from $470-500\unit{nm}$, followed by a third $532\unit{nm}$ pulse with
$200\unit{ns}$ duration that
will detect a charge in charge state of the NV center by 
exciting the NV$^0$ and collecting the fluorescence.  This pulse will also serve to re-polarize the NV center into the $m_s = 0$ state should
ionization
not have occurred, and will convert an NV$^0$ back into an NV center and re-polarize it in the event
that it had ionized.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/WP1Schematic.png}
\caption{Experimental Schematic for WP1. A computer controlled DAC controls the pulse regime to sync the microwave (MW) and the two light sources. We use a prism pair to frequency select the ionization wavelength from out Yb Fiber Supercontinuum laser. The filter used is described in Fig. \ref{IonizationEnergyandFilterFig}b.  The acousto-optic modulators (AOM) and microwave source are synchronized to the digital to analog controller (DAC) that serves as the driver for these devices.  A pulse train consisting of a 200 ns 532 nm polarization pulse, followed by a microwave Pi pulse targeted at the zero-field splitting 1 microsecond later serves to spin polarize the NV system into one of the $m_s=\pm1$ sublevels.  A second pulse train follows immediately after consisting of a 100 ns 532 nm pulse that shelves the population into the singlet state followed immediately by a 10 ps ionization pulse between 475 nm and 500 nm that will ionize the singlet into the NV$^0$ charge state if it is resonant with the separation between the metastable singlet and the conduction band edge.  A third pulse consisting of a 200 ns 532 nm pulse that recombines and repolarizes the NV$^0$ into an NV$^-$ or repolarizes the NV$^-$ if ionization did not occur.  This pulse will also serve to excite the NV$^0$ should ionization have occured, and the fluorescent output of this excitation will be coupled to a photodiode and read out through our analog to digital converter (ADC).}
\label{WP1Schematic}
\end{figure}

We will repeat this process over a wide range of ionization wavelengths and plot the output of the NV$^0$
fluorescence intensity as a function of input ionization wavelengths.  The singlet state is protected
from two-photon ionization due to the lack of an intermediate state that lies close enough to the
conduction band edge to be ionized by two photons of the same wavelength \cite{Shields2015}.  Thus the
single-photon
ionization events should contribute to a majority of the population in the NV0 charge state, with the
remainder of the population coming from two-photon ionization as a result of the polarization pulse. 
If the polarization pulse power is kept low, then the quadratic nature of the two-photon ionization
rate should contribute a negligible fraction of the NV$^0$ population when compared to the much higher
single photon ionization rate \cite{Aslam2013}.  In this way we can detect the separation between the NV singlet
state and the conduction band edge by measuring the NV$^0$, whose signal is easily separable from both the
signal of the pump and probe pulses and from the NV fluorescence with a simple filter.

\subsection{WP2: High Contrast ODMR}
Building on the results from WP1, we plan to create a technique for radically improved ODMR contrast by
utilizing the ability to map the NV$^0$ fluorescence onto the spin-state of the NV center developed in
WP1.  This technique will exploit a continuous wave ionization regime capable of ionizing from the
singlet state of the NV center and detecting the NV$^0$ as a function of microwave frequency to generate a
high-contrast ODMR spectrum necessary for high-sensitivity vectorial magnetic field measurements.  The
magnetic field sensitivity depends on the ODMR contrast according to the following equation
\cite{Dreau2011}: 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{B} (T\sqrt{Hz}) = P_F\frac{h\Delta\nu}{g\mu_B C\sqrt{R}}.
\label{ODMRSensitivity}
\end{equation}
$P_F$ is an ODMR resonance line-shape parameter, $\Delta\nu$ is the ODMR linewidth,
$C$ is the ODMR contrast, and $R$ is the count rate of fluorescence photons.  From equation \ref{ODMRSensitivity} we can see
that a full contrast ($C=1$) measurement provides more than a factor of three improvement in sensitivity
compared to the best case scenario level of contrast for a traditional ODMR measurement ($C=0.3$) with
the NV center.

We will accomplish this goal by exciting the NV$^-$ with CW $532\unit{nm}$ laser radiation from our
Nd:YAG source while performing an amplitude modulated microwave frequency sweep to populate the singlet
state (Fig. \ref{WP2Schematic}).  We will simultaneously apply laser radiation with power equal to that of the 532nm
laser radiation and a wavelength targeted at the separation of the singlet state from the conduction
band edge discovered in WP1.  This will facilitate photoionization of the singlet state when the
frequency of the microwave field is at a Zeeman resonance.  The continuous wave $532\unit{nm}$ laser radiation
will excite the population in the NV$^0$  state and provide fluorescent readout as a function of applied
microwave frequency, generating an ODMR spectrum when filtered from the NV center fluorescence and pump
excitation.  A CW regime with laser powers on the scale of $1\unit{mW}$ is necessary to ensure dominance of
single-photon ionization when applied to an NVD with a high density of NV$^-$ centers for improved ODMR contrast and to ensure sharp ODMR resonances and reduced
laser heating for enhanced sensitivity.  Lock-in detection referenced to the amplitude modulated
frequency of the microwave sweep will enhance signal collection.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/WP2Schematic.png}
\caption{Experimental Schematic for WP2. CW 532 nm and adjustable wavelength radiation tuned to the singlet ionization threshold are focused onto an NVD and a 1 kHz amplitude modulated microwave frequency sweep is applied to modulate population in the singlet state.  When the microwave frequency is in resonance with the Zeeman splitting of the ground state sublevels, the singlet state is populated by the 532 nm laser excitation and ionized into the NV$^0$ charge state by the adjustable wavelength radiation tuned to the singlet ionization threshold.  The population in the NV$^0$ charge state fluctuates in phase with the 1 kHz microwave modulation due to the periodic population of the singlet state induced by the modulated microwave energy.  Lock-in detection is used to improve signal to noise ratio of the collected NV$^0$ fluorescence.  As the microwave field is swept in frequency, ODMR fluorescence peaks appear in the plot of NV$^0$ fluorescence as a function of microwave frequency, generating an ODMR spectrum.  The NV$^-$ fluorescence and excitation wavelengths are filtered out with a 50 nm bandpass filter centered on 575 nm for enhanced ODMR contrast.}

\subsection{WP3: Enhanced Sensitivity Fiber NVD Probes for Deep Tissue Weak Field Diagnostics}
Integration of NV quantum sensors with optical fibers is tremendously beneficial for a broad class of
applications of NV-center-based magnetometry, including high-resolution, high sensitivity deep tissue
bio-medical diagnostics. As a part of the earlier work in this direction, a variety of technologies
enabling the embedding of diamond nanoparticles with NV$^-$ into specially designed optical fibers
have been developed and ultracompact fiber-optic probes integrating NV quantum sensors with a waveguide
delivery of optical and microwave fields have been demonstrated. In this work package we intend
incorporate the photoionization enhanced ODMR contrast technique developed in WP2 into our existing
fiber-optic NVD techniques in order to improve performance characteristics of these fiber-optic NVD
probe. We will use commercial diamond microcrystals, enriched with NV defects to an NV density of up to
$n \approx 10^{15}-10^{16}\unit{cm^{-3}}$ by irradiation with MeV electrons and high temperature annealing. 
These microcrystals will be deposited on the tip of an optical fiber (Fig. \ref{WP3Schematic}) with a mechanical 
manipulator under an optical microscope and attached to the fiber tip with ethyl cyanoacrylate glue.

\label{WP3Schematic}
\end{figure}

The amplitude modulated microwave excitation needed for the photoionization assisted ODMR technique will be 
delivered to the diamond microcrystal with NV$^-$ through a two-wire transmission line, running along the 
optical fiber and consisting of a pair of copper wires terminated by a loop around the NVD placed at the fiber 
tip.  Optical initialization of NV$^-$ will be delivered to the diamond microcrystal on the fiber tip through 
the core of the fiber probe. The fluorescence emitted by the NVD will be collected by the same optical fiber, 
and is returned through the fiber to the detection system, consisting of a silicon photodiode and a lock-in 
amplifier.  We will take multiple measurements of the magnetic field or the temperature at a grid of points 
around the object of interest and generate spatial magnetic field map or spatial temperature distribution of the 
object under study. 

\subsection{WP4: Characterization of ODMR dependence on temperature and IR radiation}

\end{figure}

Differentiating between the effect of temperature and the wavelength of incident IR radiation on ODMR contrast 
is of paramount importance in the development of temperature sensitive super-resolution STED microscopy.  In 
this work package, we plan to achieve this goal with two experiments. 

The first experiment in this work package will involve determining the dependence of the ODMR contrast on
temperature. We propose to accomplish this by exciting the NVD with CW 532 nm laser radiation and microwave
radiation resonant with the zero-field ground state splitting.  We will attach the diamond to a thermocouple and
apply a heat source to the NVD.  We will plot the fluorescence signal from the NVD as a function of temperature
to determine the effect of temperature on ODMR contrast. This experimental setup is shown in Fig. 
\ref{WP4TempSchematic}.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/WP4TempSchematic.png}
\caption{The experimental schematic for probing the temperature response of ODMR contrast.}
\label{WP4TempSchematic}
\end{figure}

The second experiment will involve determining the dependence of the ODMR contrast on the wavelength of incident
IR radiation.  We propose to accomplish this by again exciting the NVD with CW 532 nm laser radiation and
microwave radiation resonant with the zero-field ground state splitting, and then applying laser excitation from
a broadband IR laser.  We plan to test the dependence of the ODMR contrast on IR wavelengths between 900 nm and
2200 nm by focusing the output of a supercontinuum Yb fiber laser coupled to a 1 nm FWHM bandwidth monochromator
onto the NVD and then plotting the fluorescence signal as a function of IR wavelength applied to the NVD in 
order to determine the effect of the wavelength of IR radiation on ODMR contrast. This experimental setup is 
shown in Fig. \label{WP4IRSchematic}.

\label{WP4IRrSchematic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{WP5: Temperature sensitive super-resolution STED imaging}
In this work package we plan on leveraging the information gained about the dependence of the ODMR contrast on 
temperature to create a novel temperature sensitive STED regime.

	We plan to implement this regime by using a microscope objective to simultaneously focus 532 nm onto a high-
density NVD with integrated microwave transmission lines supplying pulsed microwave excitation with frequency 
targeted at the NV$^-$ zero-field splitting for amplitude modulation of NV$^-$ fluorescence.  This technique 
will produce bright NV$^-$ fluorescence with modulated intensity at a depth of up to 30\%.  We will then apply 
an 815 nm torus shaped beam to overlap the region illuminated with the 532nm radiation in order to induce 
stimulated emission depletion of the NVD fluorescence for super-resolution imaging.  The non-depleted, modulated 
fluorescence amplitude of the central region will be collected using a lock-in amplifier referenced to the pulse 
repetition rate of the microwave radiation to separate the background fluorescence from the desired signal.  The 
amplitude of the collected signal will be proportional to the change in temperature due to the dependence of the 
ODMR contrast on NVD temperature discovered in WP4.  This measurement will be repeated over the entire surface 
of the object under study using a 3-axis motorized translation stage in order to generate a super-resolution 
image of the object with an overlay of the spatial temperature distribution.
