\section{Broader Impact}
Using existing fiber platform NVD probe technology, ultra-high sensitivity fiber magnetometers and thermometers with submicron resolution are possible.  These probes can be used for in vivo magnetic field and temperature diagnostics of previously inaccessible deep tissue environments that are relevant to real-time spatially resolved magnetic imaging of individual neuron action potentials and sensitive subcellular thermometry necessary for the characterization of in vivo intracellular reaction kinetics.  By measuring the dependence of ODMR contrast on temperature, a novel temperature sensitive STED regime immune to background fluorescence can be developed to create nanoscale resolution temperature resolved fluorescence images as a tool for new paradigms in medical diagnostic imaging.
