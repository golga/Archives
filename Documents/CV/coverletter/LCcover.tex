I am writing in response to the Optical Inspector Position opening at RealD refered through Aerotek Staffing Agency. I am very excited at the prospect at applying my research and science experience to industrial manufacturing, and think that I am a good fit for this job posting.

While most of my experience is not directly in manufacturing I believe that my unique skill set has equipped me with the ability to preform this position at a very high level. Over the past year and a half I worked as a researcher in Liquid Crystal physics. This experience is very applicable to this employment opportunity. My duties included maintaining and using optical devices such as microscopes, optical traps, and spectral lasers. I have intimate knowledge of how to use, fix, and clean optical equipment. Prior to doing research in liquid crystals I also have multiple courses in optical theory and optical experimentation. These combined have given me 4 years of experience with optical components, providing me with a deep intuition of how optics are supposed to behave as well as an understanding of the underlying principles. This will better allow me to diagnose any errors or problems that may be presented to me.

My liquid crystal research position also has given me a abundance of knowledge of the interactions between light and liquid crystals. This has provided me unique skills and experience that is very relevant to being an optical inspector in liquid crystal manufacturing. I already have the knowledge and troubleshooting experience with liquid crystals allowing me to immediately contribute to this position with minimal training. I have constructed and measured multiple liquid crystal cells in the past.

My scientific background also has taught me the importance of careful note-taking and documentation as well as the importance of rigor and consistency in experiment. I know how to carefully record my thought processes and actions for later review and decision making. I am strong critical thinker and problem solver as well as a hard worker. I am confidant in my ability to immediately contribute to this company, as well as increasing the efficiency of the product line. I am very excited about this opportunity and am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
