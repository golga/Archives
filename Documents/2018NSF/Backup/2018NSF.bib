abstract = {In an effort to realize a two-bit processor for a quantum computer on the basis of single nitrogen-vacancy defect centers (NV centers) in diamond, the optically detected nutations of the electron spin of a single NV center in the ground state and of the nuclear spin of a 13C atom located at a diamond lattice site nearest to the NV center are studied. The photodynamics of NV and NV + 13C centers under different temperatures and optical excitation conditions is discussed. A seven-level model of a center excited by radiation from an Ar+ laser at room temperature is proposed. On the basis of this model, the experimental spectra of optically detected electron paramagnetic and electron-nuclear double resonances of single NV and NV + 13C centers in diamond nanocrystals, as well as experimental data on the optically detected nutations of the electron and nuclear spins of these centers caused by the actions of pulsed microwave and radiofrequency fields, respectively, are interpreted.},

abstract = {Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers offer a versatile platform for sensing applications spanning from nanomagnetism to in-vivo monitoring of cellular processes. In many cases, however, weak optical signals and poor contrast demand long acquisition times that prevent the measurement of environmental dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the ability to perform fast, high-contrast optical measurements of charge distributions in ensembles of NV centers in nanodiamonds and use the technique to improve the spin readout signal-to-noise ratio through spin-to-charge conversion. A study of 38 nanodiamonds, each hosting 10-15 NV centers with an average diameter of 40 nm, uncovers complex, multiple-timescale dynamics due to radiative and non-radiative ionization and recombination processes. Nonetheless, the nanodiamonds universally exhibit charge-dependent photoluminescence contrasts and the potential for enhanced spin readout using spin-to-charge conversion. We use the technique to speed up a {\$}T{\_}1{\$} relaxometry measurement by a factor of five.},

The experimental results are in good agreement with a simplified model of the NV defect spin dynamics, yielding to an optimized sensitivity around 2 $\backslash$mu T/$\backslash$sqrt{\{}$\backslash$rm Hz{\}}. We then demonstrate an enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by one order of magnitude by using a simple pulsed-ESR scheme. This technique is based on repetitive excitation of the NV defect with a resonant microwave $\backslash$pi-pulse followed by an optimized read-out laser pulse, allowing to fully eliminate power broadening of the ESR linewidth. The achieved sensitivity is similar to the one obtained by using Ramsey-type sequences, which is the optimal magnetic field sensitivity for the detection of DC magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Apart from applications in classical information-processing devices, the electrical control of atomic defects in solids at room temperature will have a tremendous impact on quantum devices that are based on such defects. In this study, we demonstrate the electrical manipulation of individual prominent representatives of such atomic solid-state defects, namely, the negative charge state of single nitrogen- vacancy defect centers (NV−) in diamond.We experimentally demonstrate, deterministic, purely electrical charge-state initialization of individual NV centers. The NV centers are placed in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode structure that facilitates the delivery of charge carriers to the defect for charge-state switching. The charge-state dynamics of a single NV center were investigated by time-resolved measurements and a nondestructive single-shot readout of the charge state. Fast charge-state switching rates (from negative to neutrally charged defects), which are greater than 0.72 pm 0.10 $\mu$s−1, were realized. Furthermore, in no-operation mode, the realized charge states were stable for presumably much more than 0.45 s. We believe that the results obtained are useful not only for ultrafast electrical control of qubits, long T2 quantum memory, and quantum sensors associated with single NV centers but also for classical memory devices based on single atomic storage bits working under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {We show stimulated emission depletion microscopy to break the diffraction limit in the all-far-field-optical detection of magnetic fields and resonances. Electron spin resonances from single nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond located at subdiffraction proximities are fully discerned. Since diffraction is overcome by disallowing the signaling state through an optical transition such as stimulated emission, the spin state remains unaffected and amenable to microwave manipulation. Stimulated emission depletion presents a universal scheme for superresolving spin resonances detectable by fluorescence. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.017601 PACS numbers: 76.70.Hb, 33.50.{\`{A}}j, 42.30.{\`{A}}d Optical detection of magnetic resonances (ODMR) pro-vides convenient access to spin states and magnetic fields, which is why optical spin readouts have been harnessed in rather diverse areas of research, such as quantum compu-tation [1,2], atomic clocks, and magnetometry [3,4]. The electron spin associated with charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is optically addressable [5], be-cause it can be polarized via an optical excitation, while its orientation can be inferred from the emitted fluorescence [6,7]. Another feature of NV spin states in isotopically purified diamond is their {\textgreater}1 ms coherence time at room temperature [8], which renders them most promising as qubits for scalable quantum computers and atom-sized all-optical sensors of magnetic fields [9]. However, when reading out or manipulating these and other optically ad-dressable spins with focused light, the obtainable spatial resolution is limited to about =ð2n sinÞ {\%} 200 nm, with and n sin denoting the wavelength of light and the numerical aperture of the lens, respectively. In fact, the resolution of all ODMR experiments performed with con-ventional optics is limited by diffraction. Recently, concepts [10] have been developed to over-come the diffraction barrier in far-field fluorescence mi-croscopy, ultimately providing a resolution down to a few nanometers. A first example is stimulated emission deple-tion (STED) microscopy [11], which overcomes the dif-fraction barrier by sequentially turning off the fluorescence of features closer than =ð2n sinÞ, such that they fluoresce consecutively from more sharply defined coordinates in space. By resolving individual electron spin resonances (ESRs) of densely packed NV centers in diamond, we now overcome the diffraction barrier in the optical detec-tion of magnetic resonances and fields. In particular, we show that STED microscopy resolves spins basically with-out a diffraction limit. A fundamental advantage of STED over a recent technique called spin-reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions [12] demonstrated with NV centers is that no microwave-induced changes in spin orientation are needed and no prior knowledge of the resonance behavior of the spins is required. The diffraction barrier is overcome just by exploiting optical transitions between a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent electronic state. Consequently, (i) the recording is virtually background-free and in the case of densely packed NV centers accel-erated up to 10 4 -fold, (ii) the spin orientation is unaffected, meaning that any ODMR sequence can be applied, and (iii) the method is not limited to NV centers but is also applicable to other systems with optically readable spins. Nonetheless, the spin associated with charged NV cen-ters in diamond is nearly perfect for demonstrating the principles of STED-ODMR. The two unpaired electrons of the NV center (a substitutional nitrogen next to a carbon vacancy) form a spin triplet in the ground state 3 A 2 with sublevels m s ¼ 0 and jm s j ¼ 1. Without external field, the jm s j ¼ 1 states are degenerate and separated by 2.87 GHz from the m s ¼ 0 state [13]. The m s can be optically probed, because m s ¼ 0 displays a higher fluorescence probability as compared to the jm s j ¼ 1 states [7], because upon optical excitation 3 A 2 ! 3 E, the jm s j ¼ 1 states exhibit an {\%} 30{\%} reduced fluorescence caused by the increased probability to cross nonradiatively from the fluorescent state},

abstract = {Cholesterol-mediated lipid interactions are thought to have a functional role in many membrane-associated processes such as signalling events. Although several experiments indicate their existence, lipid nanodomains ('rafts') remain controversial owing to the lack of suitable detection techniques in living cells. The controversy is reflected in their putative size of 5-200 nm, spanning the range between the extent of a protein complex and the resolution limit of optical microscopy. Here we demonstrate the ability of stimulated emission depletion (STED) far-field fluorescence nanoscopy to detect single diffusing (lipid) molecules in nanosized areas in the plasma membrane of living cells. Tuning of the probed area to spot sizes approximately 70-fold below the diffraction barrier reveals that unlike phosphoglycerolipids, sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are transiently ( approximately 10-20 ms) trapped in cholesterol-mediated molecular complexes dwelling within {\textless}20-nm diameter areas. The non-invasive optical recording of molecular time traces and fluctuation data in tunable nanoscale domains is a powerful new approach to study the dynamics of biomolecules in living cells.},

The technique involves selective flipping of the orientation of individual spins, associated with nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond, using a focused beam of light with intensity vanishing at a controllable location, which enables simultaneous single-spin imaging and magnetometry at the nanoscale with considerably less power than conventional techniques.

Specifically, we investigate a magnetic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond.

One intriguing possibility is the long-term storage of information, a notionwe hereby introduce usingNV-rich, type 1b diamond.As a proof of principle, we use multicolor optical microscopy to read, write, and reset arbitrary data sets with two- dimensional (2D) binary bit density comparable to present digital-video-disk (DVD) technology. Leveraging on the singular dynamics of NV− ionization, we encode information on different planes of the diamond crystal with no cross- talk, hence extending the storage capacity to three dimensions. Furthermore, we correlate the center'scharge state and the nuclear spin polarization of thenitrogen host andshowthat the latter is robust to a cycle ofNV− ionization and recharge. In combination with super-resolution microscopy techniques, these observations provide a route toward subdiffraction NV charge control, a regime where the storage capacity could exceed present technologies.},

In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

A sensor able to detect such magnetic fields with nanometre spatial resolution would enable powerful applications, ranging from the detection of magnetic resonance signals from individual electron or nuclear spins in complex biological molecules to readout of classical or quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory.

Using an ultra-pure diamond sample, we achieve detection of 3 nT magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies after 100 s of averaging.

At higher NIR intensities, selective ionization of the singlet manifold facilitates a protocol for spin-to-charge conversion that dramatically enhances the spin readout fidelity.

abstract = {Magnetic imaging is a powerful tool for probing biological and physical systems. However, existing techniques either have poor spatial resolution compared to optical microscopy and are hence not generally applicable to imaging of sub-cellular structure (for example, magnetic resonance imaging), or entail operating conditions that preclude application to living biological samples while providing submicrometre resolution (for example, scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy, electron holography and magnetic resonance force microscopy). Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states and rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks.},

abstract = {The readout of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centre electron spins is essential for applications in quantum computation, metrology and sensing. Conventional readout protocols are based on the detection of photons emitted from nitrogen-vacancy centres, a process limited by the efficiency of photon collection. We report on an alternative principle for detecting the magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centres, allowing the direct photoelectric readout of nitrogen-vacancy centres spin state in an all-diamond device. The photocurrent detection of magnetic resonance scheme is based on the detection of charge carriers promoted to the conduction band of diamond by two-photon ionization of nitrogen-vacancy centres. The optical and photoelectric detection of magnetic resonance are compared, by performing both types of measurements simultaneously. The minima detected in the measured photocurrent at resonant microwave frequencies are attributed to the spin-dependent ionization dynamics of nitrogen-vacancy, originating from spin-selective non-radiative transitions to the metastable singlet state.},

Under typical conditions, the NV can have two stable charge states, negative (NV − ) or neutral (NV 0 ), with photo-induced interconversion of these two states. Here, we present detailed studies of the ionization dynamics of single NV centres in bulk diamond at room temperature during illumination and its dependence on the excitation wavelength and power. We apply a recent method which allows us to directly measure the charge state of a single NV centre, and observe its temporal evolution. We find that the steady-state NV − population is always ⩽75{\%} for 450–610 nm excitation wavelength. In combination with saturation measurements, we show that the optimal excitation wavelength is around 510–540 nm. Furthermore, the relative absorption cross-section of NV − is determined for 540–610 nm, revealing a double-peak structure. Finally, the energy of the NV − ground state of 2.6 eV below the conduction band is measured. These results reveal new insights into the charge state dynamics of the NV centre.},

Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long ({\textgreater}10 h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1 degrees angular precision over acquisition times of 89 ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously.

abstract = {Diamond nanocrystals containing nitrogen–vacancy (NV) color centers have been used in recent years as fluorescent probes for near-field and cellular imaging. In this work, we report that an infrared (IR) pulsed excitation beam can quench the photoluminescence of a NV color center in a diamond nanocrystal (size {\textless}50 nm) with an extinction ratio as high as ≈90{\%}. We attribute this effect to the heating of the nanocrystal consecutive to multi-photon absorption by the diamond matrix. This quenching is reversible: the photoluminescence intensity goes back to its original value when the IR laser beam is turned off, with a typical response time of 100 ps, allowing for fast control of NV color center photoluminescence. We used this effect to achieve the sub-diffraction-limited imaging of fluorescent diamond nanocrystals on a coverglass. For that, as in the ground state depletion super-resolution technique, we combined the green excitation laser beam with the control IR depleting one after shaping its intensity profile in a doughnut form, so that the emission comes only from the sub-wavelength size central part.},

When the coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it can be used to engineer quantum entangled states. Entangled states have attracted widespread attention because of applications to quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. For such applications, solid-state hosts are preferred for scalability reasons, and spins are the preferred quantum system in solids because they offer long coherence times. Here we show that a single pair of strongly coupled spins in diamond, associated with a nitrogen-vacancy defect and a nitrogen atom, respectively, can be optically initialized and read out at room temperature. To effect this strong coupling, close proximity of the two spins is required, but large distances from other spins are needed to avoid deleterious decoherence. These requirements were reconciled by implanting molecular nitrogen into high-purity diamond.},

This capability has enabled a wide array of applications in metrology and quantum information science. Here, we develop a microscopic model of the state-selective ISC from the optical excited state manifold of the NV center. By correlating the electron-phonon interactions that mediate the ISC with those that induce population dynamics within the NV center's excited state manifold and those that produce the phonon sidebands of its optical transitions, we quantitatively demonstrate that our model is consistent with recent ISC measurements. Furthermore, our model constrains the unknown energy spacings between the center's spin-singlet and spin-triplet levels.

Our results offer new experimental avenues in nanooptics, nanotechnology, and the life sciences.},

abstract = {For more than a century, the resolution of focusing light microscopy has been limited by diffraction to 180 nm in the focal plane and to 500 nm along the optic axis. Recently, microscopes have been reported that provide three- to sevenfold improved axial resolution in live cells. Moreover, a family of concepts has emerged that overcomes the diffraction barrier altogether. Its first exponent, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, has so far displayed a resolution down to 28 nm. Relying on saturated optical transitions, these concepts are limited only by the attainable saturation level. As strong saturation should be feasible at low light intensities, nanoscale imaging with focused light may be closer than ever.},

abstract = {Stimulated emission depletion (STED) is the key optical technology enabling super-resolution microscopy below the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of STED in the time domain, combined with properly designed lock-in detection, can radically enhance the contrast of fluorescent images of strongly autofluorescent biotissues. In our experiments, the temporally modulated STED technique, implemented with low-intensity continuous-wave laser sources, is shown to provide an efficient all-optical suppression of a broadband fluorescent background, allowing the contrast of fluorescent images of mammal brain tissues tagged with nitrogen-vacancy diamond to be increased by five orders of magnitude.},
