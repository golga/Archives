abstract = {We propose a practical scheme to use photons from causally disconnected cosmic sources to set the detectors in an experimental test of Bell's inequality. In current experiments, detector settings are determined by local quantum random number generators. In such experiments, only a small amount of correlation between detector settings and some local hidden variables, established less than a millisecond before each experimental run, would suffice to mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics. By setting the detectors using cosmic sources instead, observed violations of Bell's inequality in our proposed "Cosmic Bell" experiment would require any such coordination to have been in place for billions of years rather than milliseconds -- an improvement of 20 orders of magnitude. Quasar pairs can be used as real-time triggers to establish detector settings using existing technology. For quasars on opposite sides of the sky with redshifts z {\textgreater} 3.65, there is no event after the hot big bang 13.8 billion years ago (following any period of inflation) that lies in the past light cones of both quasars. Alternatively, detector settings could be set by observing patches of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB, z {\~{}} 1089). For CMB patches with angular separations {\textgreater} 2.3 degrees, the events determining the detector settings would have no shared causal past since the hot big bang. In the case of the CMB, noise from the receiver and atmosphere make it difficult to rule out local influences on causal grounds alone, but a specially designed balloon-based system using state-of-the-art detectors is a realistic near-term possibility.},

abstract = {Experimental violations of Bell inequalities are in general vulnerable to so-called "loopholes." A loophole-free Bell test, closing all major loopholes simultaneously in a single experiment, is still an outstanding goal in the community. In this work, we analyse the characteristics of a definitive Bell test, closing simultaneously the locality, freedom-of-choice, fair-sampling (i.e. detection), coincidence-time, and memory loophole. We focus in particular on non-ideal random number generators for the setting choices. Due to their finite autocorrelation, such devices allow a certain predictability. We discuss a necessary adaptation of the CH/Eberhard inequality bound when using such imperfect devices, the role of bias in the setting choices, and -- using Hoeffding's inequality and Doob's optional stopping theorem -- the run time for a statistically significant Bell test.},

abstract = {In a local realist world view, physical properties are defined prior to and independent of measure- ment, and no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light. Proper experimental violation of a Bell inequality would show that the world cannot be described within local realism. Such experiments usually require additional assumptions that make them vulnerable to a number of “loopholes.” A recent experiment violated a Bell inequality without being vulnerable to the detection (or fair-sampling) loophole, therefore not needing the fair-sampling assumption. Here we analyze the more subtle coincidence-time loophole, and propose and prove the validity of two different methods of data analysis that avoid it. Both methods are general and can be used both for pulsed and continuous-wave experiments. We apply them to demonstrate that the experiment mentioned above violates local realism without being vulnerable to the coincidence-time loophole, therefore not needing the corresponding fair-coincidence assumption.},

abstract = {Bell inequalities are intended to show that local realist theories cannot describe the world. A local realist theory is one where physical properties are defined prior to and independent of measurement, and no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light. Quantum-mechanical predictions for certain experiments violate the Bell inequality while a local realist theory cannot, and this shows that a local realist theory cannot give those quantum-mechanical predictions. However, because of unexpected circumstances or "loopholes" in available experiment tests, local realist theories can reproduce the data from these experiments. This paper reviews such loopholes, what effect they have on Bell inequality tests, and how to avoid them in experiment. Avoiding all these simultaneously in one experiment, usually called a "loophole-free" or "definitive" Bell test, remains an open task, but is very important for technological tasks such as device-independent security of quantum cryptography, and ultimately for our understanding of the world.},

We derive an incompatibility theorem that works for finite numbers of polarizer settings and that does not require the previously assumed rotational symmetry of the two-particle correlation functions. The experimentally measured case involves seven different measurement settings. Using polarization- entangled photon pairs, we exclude this broader class of nonlocal realistic models by experimentally violating a new Leggett-type inequality by 80 standard deviations.},
