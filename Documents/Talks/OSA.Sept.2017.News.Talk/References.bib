abstract = {In the last two decades, many quantum optics experiments have demonstrated small-scale quantum information processing applications with several photons. Beyond such proof-of-principle demonstrations, efficient preparation of large, but definite, numbers of photons is of great importance for further scaling up and speeding up photonic quantum information processing. Typical single-photon generation techniques based on nonlinear parametric processes face challenges of probabilistic generation. Here we demonstrate efficient synchronization of photons from multiple nonlinear parametric heralded single-photon sources (HSPSs), using quantum memories (QMs). Our low-loss optical memories greatly enhance ({\~{}}30x) the generation rate of coincidence photons from two independent HSPSs, while maintaining high indistinguishability (95.7{\%}) of the synchronized photons. As an application, we perform the first demonstration of HSPS-based measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD). The synchronized HSPSs demonstrated here will pave the way toward efficient quantum communication and larger scale optical quantum computing.},
